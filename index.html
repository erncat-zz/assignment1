        <h1>Chewy Chocolate Chunk Cookies</h1>

        <h2><em>An easy, no-mixer required recipe for super chewy, soft, and perfect chocolate chip cookies.</em></h2>
        
        <p class="dropcap">There are hundreds of chocolate chip cookie recipes out there.  Everyone has their favorite! But today’s recipe stands out in my mind. They are the chewiest of chewy.  The softest of soft.  Thick, underbaked, buttery dough, and exploding with chocolate. <span>Warning</span>: this chocolate chip cookie requires a tall glass of milk.</p>

        <p>The cookie dough is made from standard cookie dough ingredients.  Flour, leavener, salt, sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla.  It’s the ratios of those ingredients that make this recipe stand out against the rest.  2.25 cups of flour is mixed with 1 teaspoon of baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and my favorite: cornstarch!  I used 1.5 teaspoons of cornstarch in this recipe.  It gives the cookies that ultra soft-baked consistency we all know and love.  Plus, it makes the cookies super thick.

You’ll use <span>melted butter</span> in this cookie recipe. Most of the cookies on my website call for creaming softened butter with the sugars.  My new chocolate chip cookie recipe requires melted butter.  It increases the chewy factor in the baked cookie. Melted butter can make your baked cookie greasy, so I made sure there was enough flour to avoid that from happening.  Since you are using melted butter, you don’t need a mixer for this cookie recipe! </p>

        <p>To the melted butter, add 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar.  Extra brown sugar increases the moist-factor, softness, and chewiness in the final cookie.  The white sugar induces slight spreading so your cookies don’t remain balls of dough in the oven.  A little bit of spread is a good thing.  Too much spreading? <em>No thank you.</em> Thankfully, these cookies remain nice and thick in the oven because of the cornstarch, flour, and baking soda.

Another way to ensure these cookies are extra chewy is to add an <span>extra egg yolk</span>.  The extra egg yolk adds richness, soft tenderness, and binds the dough. So you will need 1 egg and 1 egg yolk.  You can freeze the extra egg white in a ziplock baggie for up to 1 month.</p>

        <p>Finally, add 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and your chocolate chunks.  I used a combination of Nestle Chocolate Chunks and Mini Chocolate Chips. You can use standard size semi-sweet chocolate chips or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.

The dough will be soft and the chocolate chunks may not stick because of the melted butter. Just keep stirring it. Next step is to chill the dough. <strong>I can’t stress this step enough.</strong>  Chilling the dough is <span>mandatory</span> for most of my cookie recipes. It allows the ingredients to settle together after the mixing stage. But most importantly: <span>cold dough results in thicker cookies.</span> This cookie dough will spread in the oven if you bake it at room temperature. Cover the cookie dough and chill the dough for at least 2 hours, and even up to 3 days. I chilled this dough for 1 day. After chilling, let your cookie dough sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before rolling into balls.

After chilling, sometimes I roll the cookie dough into balls and freeze them in a large zipped-top bag. Then I bake them in their frozen state – keeping them in the oven for an extra minute.  This way you can have just one of two cookies whenever you want! </p>
        
        <p>These cookies are huge.  About 3 Tablespoons of dough is rolled to make one cookie.  The batch only makes about 16 cookies since you will be rolling them so large. Feel free to make the cookies smaller (about 2 Tablespoons of dough per cookie) instead. If you do that, be sure to <span>reduce the baking time to 8 minutes.</span> The large cookies take 11-12 minutes in the oven.  Try not to overbake them.  The cookies will appear very soft and undone.  However, they will continue to bake for about 10 minutes as you allow them to cool on the cookie sheet.</p>

            <summary>Ingredients</summary>
            <ul>
            <li>2 and 1/4 cups (280 grams) all-purpose flour, measured correctly</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (1.5 sticks or 170 grams) unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (150 grams) light brown sugar, loosely packed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg + 1 egg yolk*</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup (180 grams) chocolate chips or chocolate chunks</li>
            </ul>
        </details>

            <summary>Directions</summary>
            <ul>
            <li>Toss together the flour, baking soda, cornstarch and salt in a large bowl. Set aside. </li>

            <li>In a medium size bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together until no brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the egg, then the egg yolk. Finally, whisk in the vanilla. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft, yet thick. Fold in the chocolate chips. They may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to have them evenly dispersed among the dough. Cover the dough and chill for 2 hours, or up to 3 days. Chilling is mandatory.</li>

            <li>Take the dough out of the refrigerator and allow to slightly soften at room temperature for 10 minutes.</li>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 325F degrees. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.</li>

            <li>Roll the dough into balls, about 3 Tablespoons of dough each. The dough will be crumbly, but the warmth of your hands will allow the balls to stay intact. Roll the cookie dough balls to be taller rather than wide, to ensure the cookies will bake up to be thick. See this post for more clarity and a photo. Put 8 balls of dough onto each cookie sheet. Press a few more chocolate chips/chunks on top of the dough balls for looks, if desired. Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes. The cookies will look very soft and underbaked. They will continue to bake on the cookie sheet. Allow to cool on the cookie sheet for 10 minutes before moving to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>

            <li>Cookies stay soft and fresh for 7 whole days at room temperature. Cookies may be frozen up to 3 months. Rolled cookie dough may be frozen up to three months and baked in their frozen state for 12 minutes.</li>

        <p><small>*Room temperature egg + egg yolk are preferred for even disbursement.  Typically, if a recipe calls for room temperature or melted butter, it's a good idea to use room temperature eggs as well.  To bring eggs to room temperature quickly, simply place the whole eggs into a glass of warm water for 5 minutes.</small> </p>
